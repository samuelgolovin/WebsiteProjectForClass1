# WebsiteProjectForClass1

This is a project for school that should have 5 pages attempting to sell something.
The project workers are Samuel Golovin and Guillermo Martinez.
This shouldn't be anything fancy but just enough to look good.
A good learning project.

    //where the images are stored and why
The images are all stored inside of the css folder because of the parallax feature
that needs images. I add folders to clean up the files but realized I need images
for the css files. This was my workaround.
