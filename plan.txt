This is the plan for the website project.

Guillermo - Apple.html and Galaxy.html
Samuel - About.html and Google.html

both - add css to our pages to make them look good and both add to the index page

commit something by friday, make at least one page.

hey man, sorry about changing everything up without asking you. I didn't realize I had done this all
to the main branch and not created a new one to do all of the changed to.
But hey, now we're sort of on the same page with it all being about the same in terms of
style. But hey, if you read this, could you text me? I don't have your number saved on my phone.
I think I gave mine to you. Or we could just talk about this tomorrow in class. No biggie!
